            <p><b>Psychology is the science of behavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious phenomena, as
                    well as feeling and thought.While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and
                    treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems
                    in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit
                    society.[5][6] The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role,
                    practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range
                    of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology
                    departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are
                    employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas[7] such as human development
                    and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of
                    law.Psychology was a popular topic in Enlightenment Europe. In Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
                    (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place
                    on an indivisible continuum—most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires,
                    the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree,It is an
                    academic discipline of immense scope and diverse interests that, when taken together, seek an
                    understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of epiphenomena they
                    manifest. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general
                    principles and researching specific cases.[1][2] In this field, a professional practitioner or
                    researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive
                    scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and
                    social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie
                    cognitive functions and behaviors Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including
                    perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation
                    (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as
                    interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other
                    areas.
